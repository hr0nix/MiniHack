MiniHack
====================================

MiniHack is a sandbox framework for easily designing environments for Reinforcement Learning. MiniHack is based on the The NetHack Learning Environment (NLE) and provides a standard RL interface for customly created tesbeds.

MiniHack not only provides a diverse suite of challenging tasks but is primarily built for easily designing new ones. The motivation behind MiniHack is to be able to perform RL experiments in a controlled setting while being able to increasingly scale the difficulty and complexity of the tasks by removing simplifying assumptions. To this end, MiniHack leverages the description file (des-file) format of the game of NetHack, thereby enabling the creation of many challenging and diverse environments.
