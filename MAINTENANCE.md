We don't have a concrete schedule for updates. The updates will be communicated to users on GitHub.

## If the benchmark relates to people, are there applicable limits on the retention of the data associated with the instances.

Not applicable.

## Will older versions of the environments continue to be hosted?

The older versions of the MiniHack environments will be hosted on our repository. We are using the versioning scheme of OpenAI Gym, whereby each environment instance has a specific version assigned to it. The initial set of environments all belong to version group 0.

Yes, instructions on how to contribute to MiniHack are descripted [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
